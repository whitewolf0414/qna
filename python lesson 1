Write a program to prompt the user for days and rate per day to compute total pay. Use 50 days and a rate of 3.5 per day to test the program. Total pay is equal to (days* Rate per day). You should use input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number. Don't worry about error checking or bad user data. Good Job!
